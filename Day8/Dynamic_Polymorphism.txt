Dynamic polymorphism is a process or mechanism in which a call to an overridden method 
is to resolve at runtime rather than compile-time. It is also known as runtime polymorphism 
or dynamic method dispatch. We can achieve dynamic polymorphism by using the method overriding.

No! Declaration of static methods having the same signature can be done in the subclass 
but run time polymorphism can not take place in such cases.
Overriding or dynamic polymorphism occurs during the runtime, but the static methods are 
loaded and looked up at the compile time statically. Hence, these methods cant be overridden.

Static = class = no runtime polymorphism
