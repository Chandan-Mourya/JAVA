ClassCastException is a runtime exception raised in Java when we try to improperly cast a class from one type to another. 
It's thrown to indicate that the code has attempted to cast an object to a related class,
out of which it is not an instance.
To prevent the ClassCastException exception, one should becareful when casting objects
to a specific class or interface and ensure that the target type is a child of the source type,
and that the actual object is an instance of that type
ClassCastException is one of the unchecked exception in Java. It can occur in our program when we
tried to convert an object of one class type into an object of another class type
EXAMPLE
String[] strArray = new String[] { "John", "Snow" };
ArrayList<String> strList = (ArrayList<String>) Arrays.asList(strArray);
System.out.println("String list: " + strList);
