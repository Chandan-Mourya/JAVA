The @Autowired Annotation marks a constructor, setrer method, properties and config() method as to be autowired that is injection beans (Objects) at runtime by Spring Dependency injection mechanism.
Spring beans can be declared either by java configuration or XML configuraion.
by declearing beans you provide metadata to the spring container to return the required dependency object at runtime this is called Spring Bean Autowiring in java based annotations.
at runtime Spring will provide bean definations by reading those methodds. using @Autowired the right dependency is assigned by the Spring Container.
The modes of autowiring are:
--no means the autowiring id OFF
--byName: will look for a bean named exactly the same as the property that needs to be autowired.
--byType:- permits a property to be autowired if there is exactly one bean of the property type in the container .
--constructor:-- is equivalent to byType but operates to constructor arguments.
--Autodetect ;-has been deprecated
