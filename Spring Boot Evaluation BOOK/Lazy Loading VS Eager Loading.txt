Lazy and Eager are two types of data loading stratigies in ORMS such as hibernate and eclipse link.
these data loading stratigies we used when one entity class is having refrences to other Entities like Employee and Phone 

Lazy Loading:- Associated data loads only when we explicit call getter otr size method.
-use lazy loading when you are using one to many collections,
--use lazy loading when you are sure that you are not using releted entities.
its initial load time is much smaller than Eager  loading
it can be enabled by using the annotation 
fetch=FetchType.LAZY

Eager Loading:- data loading happens at the time of their parent s fetched.
--Use Eager Loading when the relations are not too much. Thus Eager loading is a good practice to reduce the further queries on the server.
--use eager Loading when you are sure that you will be using releted entities with the main entity everywhere.
it initial load time much unnecessory data might impact performance.
--it can be enabled by using the annotation 
fetch=FetchType.EAGER
