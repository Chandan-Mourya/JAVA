transient is a variables modifier used in Serialization.
At the time of serialization if we Dont, want to save value of a particular variable in a file.
then we use transient keyword. when JVM comes across transient keyword, it ignores original
value of the variable and save default value of that variable data type.
transient keyword plays an important role to meet security constraints. There are various
real-life examples where we dont want to save private data in file.
Another use of transient keyword is not to serialize the variable whose value can be calculated/ Dervied using
other serialized objects or System such as age of person, current date, etc.
Practiaclly we serialized only those fields which represents a state of instance, after all serialization is all
about to save state of an object to a file.
it is Good habit to use transient keyword with private confidiential fields of a class during Serialization.

private transient String password;
transient int age;

transient and static:	Since static fields are not part of state of the object, there is no use/Impact
of usnig transient keyword with static variables. However there is no compilation error.

transient and final:	final variables are directly serialized by their values, so there is no use/impact of
declaring final variable as transient. There is no compile-time error.
